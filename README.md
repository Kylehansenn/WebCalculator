# WebCalculator

Adjustments to my original calculator web application. The first version can be found [here](https://github.com/Kylehansenn/SimpleCalculator). It was a very rough draft and was just see what I could do. Since then I have larned more concepts of UI/UX and what makes a page for appealing and user friendly.

## Changes
* Overall rounder look, more natural and less "boxy" feel
* Changed default color scheme that is more modern and less plain
* Added a percentage and positive/negative function
* Replace history box with just previous calcualtion
* Changed font
* Added feature to toggle dark mode

## Deployed App

I also added one simple line of PHP in order to be deployed with Heroku.
